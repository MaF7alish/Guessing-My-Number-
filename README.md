# Guessing-My-Number-
First Project :
Guessing my Number is a Game When Player Have to guess Same Random Number!
I made this game to Learn how To use DOM and events programing With Javascript,
i learned how to call class by QuerySelector and how to Make Buttons Working by addEventListener and i learn how To get Value From The input field.
I had so much fun 😁 I'm sorry for my bad English, I'm in the process of learning it.
